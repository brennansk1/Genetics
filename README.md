# Comprehensive Genomic Health Dashboard

## Description

A Streamlit-based web application for personal genomic analysis, providing comprehensive insights into clinical risks, pharmacogenomics, polygenic risk scores, wellness traits, and advanced analytics from DNA data uploaded by users.

## Features

- **Clinical Risk & Carrier Status Analysis**: Assess genetic risks for various diseases and carrier status for inherited conditions
- **Pharmacogenomics (PGx) Report**: Analyze how genetics affect drug metabolism and response
- **Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Dashboard**: Calculate risk scores for complex diseases based on multiple genetic variants
- **Holistic Wellness & Trait Profile**: Explore genetic influences on wellness traits and lifestyle factors
- **Advanced Analytics & Exploration**: Deep dive into genetic data with custom queries and visualizations
- **Data Portability and Utility**: Export and manage genetic data in various formats
- **Multi-format Support**: Compatible with AncestryDNA, 23andMe, MyHeritage, and LivingDNA file formats

## Data Privacy

This application processes genetic data locally and does not store or transmit personal genetic information to external servers. All analysis is performed client-side for maximum privacy protection.

## Development Plans

### Phase 1: Enhanced User Experience (Q1 2024)
- [ ] Add support for additional DNA file formats (FamilyTreeDNA, Nebula Genomics)
- [ ] Implement user authentication and secure session management
- [ ] Enhance UI/UX with modern design patterns and responsive layout
- [ ] Add export functionality for analysis reports (PDF, JSON, CSV formats)

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics (Q2-Q3 2024)
- [ ] Integrate with external genetic databases (GWAS Catalog, OMIM, Ensembl)
- [ ] Develop machine learning models for improved risk prediction accuracy
- [ ] Implement real-time data validation and quality checks
- [ ] Add comparative analysis features (population vs individual)

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion (Q4 2024 - Q1 2025)
- [ ] Develop REST API endpoints for third-party integrations
- [ ] Create mobile application (React Native for iOS/Android)
- [ ] Implement collaboration features for sharing results with healthcare providers
- [ ] Add support for longitudinal genetic data tracking

### Phase 4: AI and Automation (2025)
