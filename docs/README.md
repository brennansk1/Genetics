```python
from src.bioinformatics_utils import predict_functional_impact

# Analyze SNP functional impact
impact = predict_functional_impact("rs1801133", "CT", "MTHFR")
print(f"Predicted impact: {impact['predicted_impact']}")
```

```python
from src.genomewide_prs import GenomeWidePRS

calculator = GenomeWidePRS()
result = calculator.calculate_simple_prs(snp_data, model)

print(f"Percentile: {result['percentile']}")
print(f"SNPs used: {result['snps_used']}/{result['total_snps']}")
```

#### LD Heatmap Analysis
Access through the Advanced Analytics module in the Streamlit interface to visualize linkage disequilibrium patterns between genetic variants.
